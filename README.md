# Experiment-3

Aim -> To study and implement Operators in C++

Theory -> Opeartors in C++ are the symbols that are used two perform some mathematocalor logical operations on the variables.
They are classified into 6 types: 1. Arithematic Operators (+, -, *, /, ++, --)
2. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
3. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
4. Relational Operators (==, >, >=, <=, <, !=)
5. Ternary or Conditional Operators
6. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>, ~)

Conclusion -> I learnt about using perators in C++
